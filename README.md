# [Wasmer Update] SHA256 Implementation in WebAssembly Text

I wrote the original version of this module with the assumption that NodeJS would act as the host environment.
This was all fine and everything worked correctly.
However, when I attempted to use [`Wasmer`](https://wasmer.io) as the host environment, the WASM module did not function as expected due to some differences that I was unaware of.

This update accounts for those differences.
However, in making these changes, I needed to implement some debug/trace functionality within the WASM module, which in turn, bloated the size of the binary to an enormous 3Kb (ðŸ¤£)

It was less than half of that before...

# Run The Published Package

If you simply want to run this app from the published package, then assuming you have already installed wasmer, use the command:

```bash
wasmer run chriswhealy/sha256 --mapdir <guest_dir>::<host_dir> --command-name=sha256 <host_dir>/<some_file_name>
```

In order for the `sha256` module to have access to your local file system, `wasmer` must pre-open the relevant directory on behalf of the WASM module where:

* `<guest_dir>` is the name of directory as seen by WebAssembly, and
* `<host_dir>` is the name of actual directory in your file system

For example, let's say you have a copy of War and Peace in your home directory and you want this file's hash:

```bash
wasmer run chriswhealy/sha256 --mapdir /::/Users/chris --command-name=sha256 war_and_peace.txt
11a5e2565ce9b182b980aff48ed1bb33d1278bbd77ee4f506729d0272cc7c6f7  war_and_peace.txt
```

# Local Execution

## Host Environment Prerequisites

[Install NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) plus one or more of these WebAssembly Host environments:

* Wasmer: <https://docs.wasmer.io/runtime>
* Wasmtime: <https://wasmtime.dev/>
* Wazero: <https://wazero.io/>

## Wasmer Update

* NodeJS passes three values as command line arguments to the WASM module, but host environments such as Wasmer pass only two.
* When calling this module via the Wasmer CLI, the `--dir` argument does not pre-open the directory in which the target files live.  [See here](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer/issues/5658#issuecomment-3139078222) for an explanation of this behaviour.

   Instead, you need to use the `--mapdir` argument.
* When calling `fd_read`, some WebAssembly host environments such as NodeJS or [`Wasmtime`](https://wasmtime.dev) allow you to specify a buffer size up to 4Gb.  This means that the entire file will be returned in a single call to `fd_read`.

   However, `wasmer` imposes a 2Mb upper limit on the buffer size.[^1]  Therefore, in order to read files larger than 2Mb, multiple calls to `fd_read` are required.

## Building Locally

If you wish to run this app locally,

```bash
$ npm run build

> wasm_sha256@2.0.1 build
> npm run compile & npm run opt


> wasm_sha256@2.0.1 compile
> wat2wasm ./src/sha256.wat -o ./bin/sha256.wasm


> wasm_sha256@2.0.1 opt
> wasm-opt ./bin/sha256.wasm --enable-simd --enable-multivalue --enable-bulk-memory -O4 -o ./bin/sha256_opt.wasm
```

## Local Execution: File System Access

A WASM module only has access to the files or directories pre-opened for it by the host environment.
This means that when invoking the WASM module, we must tell the host environment which directory WASM needs pre-opened.

The syntax for specifying the host directory varies between the different runtimes.

### NodeJS

The JavaScript module used to invoke the `sha256` WASM module does not use very sophisticated logic for determining the location of the target file.
Instead, it assumes the current working directory is the one containing `sha256sum.mjs` and that the target file lives in some immediate subdirectory.
The `WASI` instance then pre-opens `process.cwd()` which means the target ***must*** live in (or beneath) that directory.

```bash
$ node sha256sum.mjs ./tests/war_and_peace.txt
(node:49617) ExperimentalWarning: WASI is an experimental feature and might change at any time
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
11a5e2565ce9b182b980aff48ed1bb33d1278bbd77ee4f506729d0272cc7c6f7  ./tests/war_and_peace.txt
```

## Wasmer

Recall that when using `wasmer`, you must use the `--mapdir` argument, not the `--dir` argument.

The value passed to the `--mapdir` argument is in the form `<guest_dir>::<host_dir>`.

***IMPORTANT***<br>
You cannot specify `.` as the value of `<guest_dir>`; instead, use `/`.
This then becomes WASM's virtual root directory.

In this example, the local directory `./tests` located under the CWD becomes WASM's virtual root directory.
Consequently, the file name `war_and_peace.txt` does not require any directory name as a prefix.

```bash
$ wasmer run ./bin/sha256_opt.wasm --mapdir /::./tests -- war_and_peace.txt
11a5e2565ce9b182b980aff48ed1bb33d1278bbd77ee4f506729d0272cc7c6f7  war_and_peace.txt
$
```

## Wasmtime

When using `wasmtime`, use the `--dir <host_dir_name>` argument:

```bash
$ wasmtime --dir . ./bin/sha256_opt.wasm -- ./tests/war_and_peace.txt
11a5e2565ce9b182b980aff48ed1bb33d1278bbd77ee4f506729d0272cc7c6f7  ./tests/war_and_peace.txt
$
```

## Wazero

When using `wazero`, use the `--mount` argument uses a syntax similar to `wasmer`'s `--mapdir` argument:

```bash
$ wazero run -mount=.:. ./bin/sha256_opt.wasm ./tests/war_and_peace.txt
11a5e2565ce9b182b980aff48ed1bb33d1278bbd77ee4f506729d0272cc7c6f7  ./tests/war_and_peace.txt
$
```
