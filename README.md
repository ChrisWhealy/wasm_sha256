# SHA256 Implementation in WebAssembly Text

As a learing excerise, this is an implementation of the SHA256 algorithm written in raw WebAssembly text.

The details of the algorithm have been obtained from [SHA256 Algorithm](https://sha256algorithm.com/)

## Local Execution

Currently, the SHA256 digest of the test string `"ABCD"` is calculated

```bash
node main.js
```
