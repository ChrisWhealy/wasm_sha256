# [Wasmer Update] SHA256 Implementation in WebAssembly Text

I wrote the original version of this module with the assumption that NodeJS would act as the host environment.
This was all fine and everything worked correctly.
However, when I attempted to use [`Wasmer`](https://wasmer.io) as the host environment, the WASM module did not function as expected due to some differences that I was unaware of.

This update accounts for those differences.
However, in making these changes, I needed to implement some debug/trace functionality within the WASM module, which in turn, bloated the size of the binary to an enormous 3Kb (ðŸ¤£)

It was less than half of that before...


## Understanding the SHA256 Algorithm

In order to understand the inner workings of the SHA256 algorithm itself, take a look at this excellent [SHA256 Algorithm](https://sha256algorithm.com/) website.

## Implementation Details

An explanation of how this updated version has been implemented can be found [here](./docs/README.md)

## Host Environment Prerequisites

[Install NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) plus one or more of these WebAssembly Host environments:

* Wasmer: <https://docs.wasmer.io/runtime>
* Wasmtime: <https://wasmtime.dev/>
* Wazero: <https://wazero.io/>

## Wasmer Update

* NodeJS passes three values as command line arguments to the WASM module, but Wasmer passes only two
* When calling this module via the Wasmer CLI, the `--dir` argument does not pre-open the directory in which the target files live.

   Instead, you need to use the `--mapdir` argument.
* When calling `fd_read`, some WebAssembly host environments such as NodeJS or [`Wasmtime`](https://wasmtime.dev) allow you to specify a buffer size up to 4Gb.  This means that the entire file will be returned in a single call to `fd_read`.

   However, `wasmer` imposes a 2Mb upper limit on the buffer size.[^1]  Therefore, in order to read files larger than 2Mb, multiple calls to `fd_read` are required.

## Run The Published Package

If you simply want to run this app from the published package, you can use the command:

```bash
$ wasmer run chriswhealy/sha256 --mapdir <guest_dir>::<host_dir> --command-name=sha256 <host_dir>/<some_file_name>
```

In order for the `sha256` module to have access to your local file system, `wasmer` must pre-open the relevant directory on behalf of the WASM module where:

`<guest_dir>` is the name of directory from which the WebAssembly modules expects to read and<br>
`<host_dir>` is the name of actual directory in your file system

## Build

```bash
$ npm run build

> wasm_sha256@2.0.1 build
> npm run compile & npm run opt


> wasm_sha256@2.0.1 compile
> wat2wasm ./src/sha256.wat -o ./bin/sha256.wasm


> wasm_sha256@2.0.1 opt
> wasm-opt ./bin/sha256.wasm --enable-simd --enable-multivalue --enable-bulk-memory -O4 -o ./bin/sha256_opt.wasm
```

## Important: File System Access

A WASM module only has access to the files or directories pre-opened for it by the host environemnt.
This means that when invoking the WASM module, we must tell the host environment which directory WASM needs access to:

### NodeJS

The JavaScript module used to invoke the `sha256` module does not use very sophisticated logic for determining the location of the target file.
Instead, it assumes the `sha256sum.mjs` program exists in the current working directory and that the target file lives in some immediate subdirectory.
The `WASI` instance then pre-opens `process.cwd()` which means the target ***must*** live in (or beneath) that directory.

```bash
$ node sha256sum.mjs ./tests/war_and_peace.txt

```

## Wasmer

```bash
$ wasmer run ./bin/sha256_opt.wasm --mapdir /tests::./tests -- /tests/war_and_peace.txt
11a5e2565ce9b182b980aff48ed1bb33d1278bbd77ee4f506729d0272cc7c6f7  ./tests/war_and_peace.txt
$
```

## Wasmtime

```bash
$ wasmtime --dir . ./bin/sha256_opt.wasm -- ./tests/war_and_peace.txt
11a5e2565ce9b182b980aff48ed1bb33d1278bbd77ee4f506729d0272cc7c6f7  ./tests/war_and_peace.txt
$
```

## Wazero

```bash
$ wazero run -mount=.:. ./bin/sha256_opt.wasm ./tests/war_and_peace.txt
11a5e2565ce9b182b980aff48ed1bb33d1278bbd77ee4f506729d0272cc7c6f7  ./tests/war_and_peace.txt
$
```
